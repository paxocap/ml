log likelihood val for unigram model = -35.2743
log likelihood val for bigram model = -29.5379
Bigram model yields the highest log-likelihood
log likelihood val for bigram model if we consider </s> at the end = -inf
oops! it seems for missing entries in index count table in bigram model can lead to erraneous log likelihood value!
